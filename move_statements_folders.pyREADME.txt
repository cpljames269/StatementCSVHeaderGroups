move_statements_folders.py
Purpose:
Moves only the folders whose jobticket.xml indicates they are "Statements from CSV" into a dedicated statements subfolder for specialized handling or processing.

How it works:

Scans all folders under:

makefile
Copy
Edit
C:\testing
For each subfolder:

Looks for the first .xml file

Parses the XML and checks the <product> field inside the <general> block

If the value is "Statements from CSV", the entire folder is moved to:

makefile
Copy
Edit
C:\testing\statements
Skips folders:

Without an .xml file

Where the <product> field is not "Statements from CSV"

Output:
Moves only the folders that match the target product to this location:

python-repl
Copy
Edit
C:\testing\statements\
├── HOA123\
│   ├── jobticket.xml
│   └── original.csv
├── HOA456\
│   ├── jobticket.xml
│   └── original.csv
...
Used for:

Isolating statement jobs from other jobs before analysis or parsing

A prep step before running analyze_find_similar.py (which expects only relevant folders)

Typical Use Case:
After running CopyXMLandCSVintoSeparateFolders.py, use this script to separate statement jobs from everything else.

Notes:

Parsing errors are logged to the console

Won’t delete or overwrite folders; only moves valid targets

Expects a consistent XML structure with <general><product> present
