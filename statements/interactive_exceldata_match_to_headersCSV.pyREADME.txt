interactive_exceldata_match_to_headersCSV.py
Purpose:
Performs interactive fuzzy matching between customer names found in csv_header_groups.json and client names from a filtered customer list (clients_filtered.csv). Used to map external metadata (e.g., Software, Bank, Client ID) to customer names in your parsed statement data.

How it works:

Loads:

Customer names from csv_header_groups.json

Client details from clients_filtered.csv (must include "Client Name" column)

Uses fuzzy string matching (via thefuzz) to suggest the best CSV match for each JSON customer name

Prompts you to confirm or adjust each match

Saves confirmed name pairs to confirmed_matches.json

Example workflow:

pgsql
Copy
Edit
JSON Customer Name: trestle management group
Best CSV match: trestle management group - az (score: 96)
Is this a correct match? (y/n): y
Or:

sql
Copy
Edit
Is this a correct match? (y/n): n
Other possible matches:
1: trestle group - ca (score: 91)
2: ...
Enter number to select a different match or 'skip' to skip:
Output: confirmed_matches.json

json
Copy
Edit
{
  "trestle management group": "trestle management group - az",
  "essex association management lp": "essex association management lp - tx"
}
Used by:

Scripts that enrich csv_header_groups.json with additional client metadata
(e.g., Software, Bank, Client ID)

Notes:

Requires thefuzz package (pip install thefuzz[speedup])

This script is interactive only. It's meant to confirm new matches as customer data grows.
