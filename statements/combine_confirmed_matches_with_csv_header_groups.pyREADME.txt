combine_confirmed_matches_with_csv_header_groups.py
Purpose:
Takes the confirmed name mappings from confirmed_matches.json and enriches csv_header_groups.json by injecting metadata fields from clients_filtered.csv (like Bank(s), Software(s), and Client ID).

How it works:

Loads:

csv_header_groups.json → the base parsed customer data

clients_filtered.csv → the metadata spreadsheet (already exported to CSV)

confirmed_matches.json → manually confirmed fuzzy matches between JSON names and CSV names

For every match:

Finds the matching client record in the CSV

Injects the following metadata into each corresponding JSON entry:

Client ID

Bank(s)

Software(s)

Saves a new file:
➜ rename_to-csv_header_groups.json

Used by:

Final enrichment stage before the web app renders the updated data.

After renaming rename_to-csv_header_groups.json to csv_header_groups.json, your web app reflects the new enriched metadata.

Output example snippet:

json
Copy
Edit
{
  "customer_name": "Trestle Management Group",
  "hoa_name": "Trestle HOA",
  "folder": "trestle_072024",
  "Client ID": "2688",
  "Bank(s)": "* First Citizen's Bank",
  "Software(s)": "* TOPS One"
}
Usage sequence:

Run interactive_exceldata_match_to_headersCSV.py to confirm matches

Then run this script to merge and enrich data

Notes:

Non-matching entries in the JSON will be left unchanged.

Confirmed matches must be lowercase and stripped (handled automatically by the script).

Final output will need to be renamed manually (as the filename implies).
